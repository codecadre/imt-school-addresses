## What's this

Portuguese driving schools as available in the [IMT website](https://www.imt-ip.pt/sites/IMTT/Portugues/EnsinoConducao/LocalizacaoEscolasConducao/Paginas/LocalizacaoEscolasConducao.aspx).

This was originally done for [passaprimeira.xyz](https://www.passaprimeira.xyz).

## Background

[passaprimeira.xyz](https://www.passaprimeira.xyz) is the second iteration of a project that aims at bringing transparency to the driving school business in Portugal, by crossing public data and presenting it in an accessible format. Originally it was only a web app, but we decided to release some of the data and code, in a usable way, so that others could benefit form it.

## Data Origin

[IMT website](https://www.imt-ip.pt/sites/IMTT/Portugues/EnsinoConducao/LocalizacaoEscolasConducao/Paginas/LocalizacaoEscolasConducao.aspx)

## How to use it

Probably what you want is the output at

- `parsed-data/db.json`
- `parsed-data/db.edn`
- `parsed-data/db.txt` (for debug but easier to look at for a quick reference)

## unique ids and data issues

Schools have an integer number which is unique for the most part. IMT calls this the "school number", "nec" or "alvar√°".

However, given that this number appears associated with [multiple schools with different numbers](https://github.com/codecadre/imt-school-addresses/blob/20b1d3a0a4d05c54a906b3c2f55d4ea92ac73d70/duplicates.txt), etc, we added a UUID deterministically generated from the url of each school, which by definition, is a unique record.


## Steps to reproduce this:

### Dependencies

To reproduce the parsing and data processing, you need [`babashka`](https://babashka.org/) and [`nbb`](https://github.com/babashka/nbb).

### Install

```
npm i
```

## Run

```
nbb hrefs.cljs
```

Runs puppeteer script and produces `hrefs.json` - a collection of links for each school page.

```
bb schools.clj
```

Pulls each school page and produces `schools.edn` with the details.

## nrepl

```
bb nrepl
```

for .`clj` files and

```
nbb nrepl-server :port 1337
```

for `*.cljs` files
